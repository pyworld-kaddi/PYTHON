ALL ABOUT CHAPTERS 
---------------------

CHAPTER-1: getting started
          
        Introduction:
                In this chapter, you’ll run your first Python program,hello_world.py. First, you’ll need to check whether
                a recent version of Python is installed on your computer. if it isn’t, you’ll install it.You’ll also install
                a text editor to work with your Python programs.Text editors recognize Python code and highlight sections
                as you write, making it easy to understand your code’s structure.
        
        Summary:
                In this chapter, you learned a bit about Python in general, and you installed Python on your system if it
                wasn’t already there. You also installed a text edi-tor to make it easier to write Python code. You ran 
                snippets of Python code in a terminal session,and you ran your first program, hello_world.py. You probably
                learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
                    
                In the next chapter,you’ll learn about the different kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs, 
                and you’ll start to use variables as well.

CHAPTER-2: variables and simple data types

        Introduction:
                In this chapter you’ll learn about the dif-ferent kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs.
                You’ll also learn how to use variables to represent data in your programs. 

        Summary:
                In this chapter you learned how to work with variables. You learned to use descriptive variable names and
                resolve name errors and syntax errors when they arise.You learned what strings are and how to display them
                using low-ercase, uppercase, and title case. You started using whitespace to organize output neatly,and you
                learned how to remove unneeded elements from a string. You started working with integers and floats,and you 
                learned some of the ways you can work with numerical data.You also learned to write explanatory comments to 
                make your code easier for you and others to read.Finally, you read about the philosophy of keeping your code
                as simple as possible,whenever possible.
                    
                In Chapter 3,you’ll learn how to store collections of information in data structures called lists.You’ll also
                learn how to work through a list,manipulating any information in that list.

CHAPTER-3: Introducing lists

        Introduction:
                In this chapter and the next you’ll learn what lists are,and how to start working with the elements in a list. 
                Lists allow you to store sets of information in one place,whether you have just a few items or millions of 
                items.Lists are one of Python’s most powerful features readily acces-sible to new programmers, and they tie 
                together many important concepts in programming.

        Summary:
                In this chapter, you learned what lists are and how to work with the indi-vidual items in a list. You learned 
                how to define a list and how to add and remove elements. You learned how to sort lists permanently and 
                temporar-ily for display purposes.You also learned how to find the length of a list,and how to avoid index 
                errors when you’re working with lists.
                    
                In Chapter 4 you’ll learn how to work with items in a list more efficiently.By looping through each item in a
                list using just a few lines of code you’ll be able to work efficiently, even when your list contains thousands
                or millions of items.

CHAPTER-4: Working with lists

        Introduction:
                In Chapter 3 you learned how to make a simple list, and you learned to work with the individual elements in a
                list.In this chapter you’ll learn how to loop through an entire list using just a few lines of code,regardless 
                of how long the list is.Looping allows you to take the same action,or set of actions,with every item in a list. 
                As a result, you’ll be able to work efficiently with lists of any length,including those with thousands or even 
                millions of items.

        Summary:
                In this chapter, you learned how to work efficiently with the elements in a list.learned how to work through a list
                using a for loop,how Python uses indentation to structure a program,and how to avoid some common indentation errors. 
                You learned to make simple numerical lists, as well as a few operations you can perform on numerical lists.You learned
                how to slice a list to work with a subset of items and how to copy lists properly using a slice.You also learned about
                tuples,which provide a degree of protection to a set of values that shouldn’t change,and how to style your increasingly
                complex code to make it easy to read.
                    
                In Chapter5,you’ll learn to respond appropriately to different condi-tions by using if statements. You’ll learn to 
                string together relatively complex sets of conditional tests to respond appropriately to exactly the kind of situa-tion
                or information you’re looking for.You’ll also learn to use if statements while looping through a list to take specific
                actions with selected elements from a list. 

CHAPTER-5: IF Statements

        Introduction:
                Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions.
                Python’s if statement allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appro-priately to that state.
                In this chapter, you’ll learn to write conditional tests, which allow you to check any condition of interest. You’ll
                learn to write simple if statements, and you’ll learn how to create a more complex series of if statements to identify
                when the exact conditions you want are present. You’ll then apply this concept to lists, so you’ll be able to write a 
                for loop that handles most items in a list one way but handles certain items with specific values in a dif-ferent way.
        
        Summary:
                In this chapter you learned how to write conditional tests, which always evaluate to True or False. You learned to write simple if statements, if-else chains, and if-elif-else chains. You began using these structures to identify particular conditions you need to test and to know when those conditions have been met in your programs. You learned to handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a for loop. You also revisited Python’s style recommendations to ensure that your increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and understand.In Chapter 6 you’ll learn about Python’s dictionaries. A dictionary is similar to a list, but it allows you to connect pieces of information. You’ll learn how to build dictionaries, loop through them, and use them in combi-nation with lists and if statements. Learning about dictionaries will enable you to model an even wider variety of real-world situations
CHAPTER-6: Dictionaries

        Introduction:
                In this chapter you’ll learn how to use Python’s dictionaries, which allow you to con-nect pieces of related information. You’ll learn how to access the information once it’s in a dic-tionary and how to modify that information. Because dictionaries can store an almost limitless amount of  information, I’ll show you how to loop through the data in a dictionary. Additionally, you’ll learn to nest dictionaries inside lists, lists inside diction-aries, and even dictionaries inside other dictionaries.Understanding dictionaries allows you to model a variety of real-world objects more accurately. You’ll be able to create a dictionary representing a person and then store as much information as you want about that person. You can store their name, age, location, profession, and any other aspect of a person you can describe. You’ll be able to store any two kinds of informa-tion that can be matched up, such as a list of words and their meanings, a list of people’s names and their favorite numbers, a list of mountains and their elevations, and so forth.
