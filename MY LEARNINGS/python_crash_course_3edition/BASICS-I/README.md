ALL CHAPTERS SUMMARY
---------------------

CHAPTER-1: getting started
          
        Introduction:
                   In this chapter, you’ll run your first Python program, hello_world.py. First, you’ll need to check whether a recent version of Python is installed on your computer; if it isn’t, you’ll install it. You’ll also install a text editor to work with your Python programs. Text editors recognize Python code and highlight sections as you write, making it easy to understand your code’s structure.
        
        Summary:
                    In this chapter, you learned a bit about Python in general, and you installed Python on your system if it wasn’t already there. You also installed a text edi-tor to make it easier to write Python code. You ran snippets of Python code in a terminal session, and you ran your first program, hello_world.py. You probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
                    
                    In the next chapter, you’ll learn about the different kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs, and you’ll start to use variables as well.

CHAPTER-2: variables and simple data types

        Introduction:
                    In this chapter you’ll learn about the dif-ferent kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs. You’ll also learn how to use variables to represent data in your programs.
