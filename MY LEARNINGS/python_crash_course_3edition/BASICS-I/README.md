ALL ABOUT CHAPTERS 
---------------------

CHAPTER-1: getting started
          
        Introduction:
                   In this chapter, you’ll run your first Python program, 
                   hello_world.py. 
                   First, you’ll need to check whether a recent version of Python is installed on your computer
                   if it isn’t, you’ll install it. 
                   You’ll also install a text editor to work with your Python programs. 
                   Text editors recognize Python code and highlight sections as you write,
                   making it easy to understand your code’s structure.
        
        Summary:
                    In this chapter, you learned a bit about Python in general, 
                    and you installed Python on your system if it wasn’t already there. 
                    You also installed a text edi-tor to make it easier to write Python code. 
                    You ran snippets of Python code in a terminal session, 
                    and you ran your first program, hello_world.py. 
                    You probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
                    
                    In the next chapter, 
                    you’ll learn about the different kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs, 
                    and you’ll start to use variables as well.

CHAPTER-2: variables and simple data types

        Introduction:
                    In this chapter you’ll learn about the dif-ferent kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs.
                    You’ll also learn how to use variables to represent data in your programs. 

        Summary:
                    In this chapter you learned how to work with variables. 
                    You learned to use descriptive variable names and resolve name errors and syntax errors when they arise. 
                    You learned what strings are and how to display them using low-ercase, uppercase, and title case. 
                    You started using whitespace to organize output neatly,
                    and you learned how to remove unneeded elements from a string. 
                    You started working with integers and floats,
                    and you learned some of the ways you can work with numerical data. 
                    You also learned to write explanatory comments to make your code easier for you and others to read.
                    Finally, you read about the philosophy of keeping your code as simple as possible, 
                    whenever possible.
                    
                    In Chapter 3, 
                    you’ll learn how to store collections of information in data structures called lists. 
                    You’ll also learn how to work through a list, 
                    manipulating any information in that list.

CHAPTER-3: Introducing lists

        Introduction:
                    In this chapter and the next you’ll learn what lists are, 
                    and how to start working with the elements in a list. 
                    Lists allow you to store sets of information in one place,
                    whether you have just a few items or millions of items. 
                    Lists are one of Python’s most powerful features readily acces-sible to new programmers, 
                    and they tie together many important concepts in programming.

        Summary:
                    In this chapter, you learned what lists are and how to work with the indi-vidual items in a list. 
                    You learned how to define a list and how to add and remove elements. 
                    You learned how to sort lists permanently and temporar-ily for display purposes.
                    You also learned how to find the length of a list,
                    and how to avoid index errors when you’re working with lists.
                    
                    In Chapter 4 you’ll learn how to work with items in a list more efficiently.
                    By looping through each item in a list using just a few lines of code you’ll be able to work efficiently, 
                    even when your list contains thousands or millions of items.
