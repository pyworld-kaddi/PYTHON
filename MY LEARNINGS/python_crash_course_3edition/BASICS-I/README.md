ALL ABOUT CHAPTERS 
---------------------

CHAPTER-1: getting started
          
        Introduction:
                In this chapter, you’ll run your first Python program,hello_world.py. First, you’ll need to check whether
                a recent version of Python is installed on your computer. if it isn’t, you’ll install it.You’ll also install
                a text editor to work with your Python programs.Text editors recognize Python code and highlight sections
                as you write, making it easy to understand your code’s structure.
        
        Summary:
                In this chapter, you learned a bit about Python in general, and you installed Python on your system if it
                wasn’t already there. You also installed a text edi-tor to make it easier to write Python code. You ran 
                snippets of Python code in a terminal session,and you ran your first program, hello_world.py. You probably
                learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
                    
                In the next chapter,you’ll learn about the different kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs, 
                and you’ll start to use variables as well.

CHAPTER-2: variables and simple data types

        Introduction:
                In this chapter you’ll learn about the dif-ferent kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs.
                You’ll also learn how to use variables to represent data in your programs. 

        Summary:
                In this chapter you learned how to work with variables. You learned to use descriptive variable names and
                resolve name errors and syntax errors when they arise.You learned what strings are and how to display them
                using low-ercase, uppercase, and title case. You started using whitespace to organize output neatly,and you
                learned how to remove unneeded elements from a string. You started working with integers and floats,and you 
                learned some of the ways you can work with numerical data.You also learned to write explanatory comments to 
                make your code easier for you and others to read.Finally, you read about the philosophy of keeping your code
                as simple as possible,whenever possible.
                    
                In Chapter 3,you’ll learn how to store collections of information in data structures called lists.You’ll also
                learn how to work through a list,manipulating any information in that list.

CHAPTER-3: Introducing lists

        Introduction:
                In this chapter and the next you’ll learn what lists are,and how to start working with the elements in a list. 
                Lists allow you to store sets of information in one place,whether you have just a few items or millions of 
                items.Lists are one of Python’s most powerful features readily acces-sible to new programmers, and they tie 
                together many important concepts in programming.

        Summary:
                In this chapter, you learned what lists are and how to work with the indi-vidual items in a list. You learned 
                how to define a list and how to add and remove elements. You learned how to sort lists permanently and 
                temporar-ily for display purposes.You also learned how to find the length of a list,and how to avoid index 
                errors when you’re working with lists.
                    
                In Chapter 4 you’ll learn how to work with items in a list more efficiently.By looping through each item in a
                list using just a few lines of code you’ll be able to work efficiently, even when your list contains thousands
                or millions of items.

CHAPTER-4: Working with lists

        Introduction:
                In Chapter 3 you learned how to make a simple list, and you learned to work with the individual elements in a
                list.In this chapter you’ll learn how to loop through an entire list using just a few lines of code,regardless 
                of how long the list is.Looping allows you to take the same action,or set of actions,with every item in a list. 
                As a result, you’ll be able to work efficiently with lists of any length,including those with thousands or even 
                millions of items.

        Summary:
                In this chapter, you learned how to work efficiently with the elements in a list.learned how to work through a list
                using a for loop,how Python uses indentation to structure a program,and how to avoid some common indentation errors. 
                You learned to make simple numerical lists, as well as a few operations you can perform on numerical lists.You learned
                how to slice a list to work with a subset of items and how to copy lists properly using a slice.You also learned about
                tuples,which provide a degree of protection to a set of values that shouldn’t change,and how to style your increasingly
                complex code to make it easy to read.
                    
                In Chapter5,you’ll learn to respond appropriately to different condi-tions by using if statements. You’ll learn to 
                string together relatively complex sets of conditional tests to respond appropriately to exactly the kind of situa-tion
                or information you’re looking for.You’ll also learn to use if statements while looping through a list to take specific
                actions with selected elements from a list. 

CHAPTER-5: IF Statements

        Introduction:
                Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions.
                Python’s if statement allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appro-priately to that state.
                In this chapter, you’ll learn to write conditional tests, which allow you to check any condition of interest. You’ll
                learn to write simple if statements, and you’ll learn how to create a more complex series of if statements to identify
                when the exact conditions you want are present. You’ll then apply this concept to lists, so you’ll be able to write a 
                for loop that handles most items in a list one way but handles certain items with specific values in a dif-ferent way.
        
        Summary:
                In this chapter you learned how to write conditional tests, which always evaluate to True or False. You learned to write simple if statements, if-else chains, and if-elif-else chains. You began using these structures to identify particular conditions you need to test and to know when those conditions have been met in your programs. You learned to handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a for loop. You also revisited Python’s style recommendations to ensure that your increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and understand.In Chapter 6 you’ll learn about Python’s dictionaries. A dictionary is similar to a list, but it allows you to connect pieces of information. You’ll learn how to build dictionaries, loop through them, and use them in combi-nation with lists and if statements. Learning about dictionaries will enable you to model an even wider variety of real-world situations
CHAPTER-6: Dictionaries

        Introduction:
                In this chapter you’ll learn how to use Python’s dictionaries, which allow you to con-nect pieces of related information. You’ll learn how to access the information once it’s in a dic-tionary and how to modify that information. Because dictionaries can store an almost limitless amount of  information, I’ll show you how to loop through the data in a dictionary. Additionally, you’ll learn to nest dictionaries inside lists, lists inside diction-aries, and even dictionaries inside other dictionaries.Understanding dictionaries allows you to model a variety of real-world objects more accurately. You’ll be able to create a dictionary representing a person and then store as much information as you want about that person. You can store their name, age, location, profession, and any other aspect of a person you can describe. You’ll be able to store any two kinds of informa-tion that can be matched up, such as a list of words and their meanings, a list of people’s names and their favorite numbers, a list of mountains and their elevations, and so forth.

        Summary:
                In this chapter, you learned how to define a dictionary and how to work with  the information stored in a dictionary. You learned how to access and  modify individual elements in a dictionary, and how to loop through all of the information in a dictionary. You learned to loop through a diction-ary’s key-value pairs, its keys, and its values. You also learned how to nest multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside a dictionary.In the next chapter you’ll learn about while loops and how to accept input from people who are using your programs. This will be an exciting chapter, because you’ll learn to make all of your programs interactive: they’ll be able to respond to user input.

CHAPTER 7: User inputs and while loops

        Introduction:
                Most programs are written to solve an end user’s problem. To do so, you usually need to get some information from the user. For example, say someone wants to find out whether they’re old enough to vote. If you write a program to answer this question, you need to know the user’s age  before you can provide an answer. The program will need to ask the user to enter, or input, their age; once the program has this input, it can com-pare it to the voting age to determine if the user is old enough and then report the result.In this chapter you’ll learn how to accept user input so your program can then work with it. When your program needs a name, you’ll be able to prompt the user for a name. When your program needs a list of names, you’ll be able to prompt the user for a series of names. To do this, you’ll use the input() function.You’ll also learn how to keep programs running as long as users want them to, so they can enter as much information as they need to; then, your program can work with that information. You’ll use Python’s while loop to keep programs running as long as certain conditions remain true.With the ability to work with user input and the ability to control how long your programs run, you’ll be able to write fully interactive programs

        Summary:
                In this chapter, you learned how to use input() to allow users to provide their own information in your programs. You learned to work with both text and numerical input and how to use while loops to make your programs run as long as your users want them to. You saw several ways to control the flow of a while loop by setting an active flag, using the break statement, and using the continue statement. You learned how to use a while loop to move items from one list to another and how to remove all instances of a value from a list. You also learned how while loops can be used with dictionaries.In Chapter 8 you’ll learn about functions. Functions allow you to break your programs into small parts, each of which does one specific job. You can call a function as many times as you want, and you can store your functions in separate files. By using functions, you’ll be able to write more efficient code that’s easier to troubleshoot and maintain and that can be reused in many different programs.

CHAPTER 8: Functions    
        
        Introduction:
                In this chapter you’ll learn to write func-tions, which are named blocks of code designed to do one specific job. When you want to perform a particular task that you’ve defined in a function, you call the function respon-sible for it. If you need to perform that task multiple times throughout your program, you don’t need to type all the code for the same task again and again;  you just call the function dedicated to handling that task, and the call tells Python to run the code inside the function. You’ll find that using functions makes your programs easier to write, read, test, and fix.In this chapter you’ll also learn a variety of ways to pass information to functions. You’ll learn how to write certain functions whose primary job is to display information and other functions designed to process data and return a value or set of values. Finally, you’ll learn to store functions in sep-arate files called modules to help organize your main program files
        
        Summary:
                In this chapter, you learned how to write functions and to pass arguments so that your functions have access to the information they need to do their work. You learned how to use positional and keyword arguments, and also how to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. You saw functions that display output and functions that return values. You learned how to use functions with lists, dictionaries, if statements, and while loops. You also saw how to store your functions in separate files called modules, so your program files will be simpler and easier to understand. Finally, you learned to style your functions so your programs will continue to be well-structured and as easy as possible for you and others to read.One of your goals as a programmer should be to write simple code that does what you want it to, and functions help you do this. They allow you to write blocks of code and leave them alone once you know they work. When you know a function does its job correctly, you can trust that it will continue to work and move on to your next coding task.Functions allow you to write code once and then reuse that code as many times as you want. When you need to run the code in a function, all you need to do is write a one-line call and the function does its job. When you need to modify a function’s behavior, you only have to modify one block of code, and your change takes effect everywhere you’ve made a call to that function.Using functions makes your programs easier to read, and good func-tion names summarize what each part of a program does. Reading a series of function calls gives you a much quicker sense of what a program does than reading a long series of code blocks.      Functions also make your code easier to test and debug. When the bulk of your program’s work is done by a set of functions, each of which has a specific job, it’s much easier to test and maintain the code you’ve written. You can write a separate program that calls each function and tests whether each function works in all the situations it may encounter. When you do this, you can be confident that your functions will work properly each time you call them.In Chapter 9, you’ll learn to write classes. Classes combine functions and data into one neat package that can be used in flexible and efficient ways.

CHAPTER 9: Classes

        Introduction:
                Object-oriented programming (OOP) is one of the most effective approaches to writing software. In object-oriented programming, you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have.When you create individual objects from the class, each object is auto-matically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire. You’ll be amazed how well real-world situations can be modeled with object-oriented programming.Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with instances of a class. In this chapter you’ll write classes and create instances of those classes. You’ll specify the kind of information that can be stored in instances, and you’ll define actions that can be taken with these instances. You’ll also write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes, so similar classes can share common functionality, and you can do more with less code. You’ll store your classes in modules and import classes written by other programmers into your own program files.Learning about object-oriented programming will help you see the world as a programmer does. It’ll help you understand your code—not just what’s happening line by line, but also the bigger concepts behind it. Knowing the logic behind classes will train you to think logically, so you can write pro-grams that effectively address almost any problem you encounter.Classes also make life easier for you and the other programmers you’ll work with as you take on increasingly complex challenges. When you and other programmers write code based on the same kind of logic, you’ll be able to understand each other’s work. Your programs will make sense to the people you work with, allowing everyone to accomplish more.
        
        Summary:
